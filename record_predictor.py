Plan:
1. Get projected data for each team
    -maybe PER regression for each player, average based on MP and match up each team?
    -maybe ppg, fg%, 3fg%, ft% regression, average for team match them up?
    -BPM, RPM ---> Do all of them and see which stats are the best predictors of team record
2. Do the regressions, score each team
3. Match teams up by upcoming schedule, assign W/L, get record for each team
